  <h1>Colophon</h1>

  <p>Like almost all aspects of the Taoist Tai Chi Society, this website has been maintained by a series of volunteers, most recently by <a href="[% site.uris.humans %]">Darren Chamberlain</a>.  Please direct all complaints about the design, content, and usability directly to <a href="mail:ttcs@sevenroot.org">him</a>.</p>

  <h2>Technical Mumbo-Jumbo</h2>
  
  <p>The site is hand-coded in (relatively) modern HTML, complete with metadata, and uses the fantastic <a href="http://960.gs/">960 Grid System</a> for layout, since I'm a very poor designer.  The templates and content are stored in <a href="https://github.com/dlc/ttcsbrandon/">GitHub</a>, edited in <a href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a>, and built using the <a href="http://www.tt2.org/">Template Toolkit</a>.</p>

  <p>The <a href="[% site.uris.calendar %]">calendar</a> and <a href="[% site.uris.location %]">location</a> pages are made possible by <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar">Google Calendar</a> and <a href="http://maps.google.com/">Google Maps</a>, respectively.</p>

  <h2>Photos</h2>
