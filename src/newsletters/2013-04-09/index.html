<p>Hear ye, hear ye the time of ye olde monthly newsletter is nigh:</p>

<p>There is no link this month to a Bay Area newsletter.  Roger Boese from the Dunedin branch, who produced the newsletter, is/has moved to Washington D.C.  Roger did a lot of work over the years on the newsletter &mdash;  thanks and I wish you well!  I guess we're on our own for now. Yikes!</p>

<p>First, a thank you to everyone who has donated food for the Emergency Care Help Organization (ECHO).  Laurie Farrar has spear-headed this effort and, as of March 28, we had donated 92 ibs.  Nice work everyone.  Community service is one way to fulfill the Society's objective of helping others.</p>

<p>Sunday, April 14 will be Tai Chi in the Park at 9 am at Lettuce Lake park in Tampa.</p>

<p>Saturday, April 20 will be our second road clean-up of the year.  We will break for the summer months and have 2 more in the fall/winter.  This is another form of community service that the Brandon branch has been performing since before I joined in January of 2000.</p>

<p>Friday, April 26 at 8 am will be the next chance to join us at the center for breakfast.  You may then stick around for continuing class.  Leanne Sparks and crew have been working hard to make these events a success.  By the satisfied looks, I'd say it's working Leanne.</p>

<p>On Saturday, May 4, Brandon will host the next Open House from 11 am to 1p pm, and Temple Terrace will host from 2 to 4 pm.  This is our chance to show off what we are about &mdash; come join in and/or bring a friend.  You never know whose life you might affect for the better.</p>

<p>On Sunday, May 5, Sarasota will be hosting a tai chi intensive from 9 am to noon.  This will be led by Sean Dennison and Karen Laughlin, so there will be no class or chanting in Brandon that morning.  Instructors and set leaders are expected to attend, whenever possible, a local intensive led by an international instructor and we've been told protocol is to cancel classes so this can occur.  The branch will hold their Branch Annual Meeting immediately after, then will begin to set up for the Mother's Day banquet from 1 to 4 pm.  RSVP for the banquet by April 22.  The intensive is $25 and the banquet tickets are $25 each.</p>

<p>The big event for Brandon this year will be the International Tai Chi Workshop on May 25 and 26.  This is the weekend before Memorial Day, so we hope to have another good turnout.  The workshop will be led by Jim Nicholson from Vancouver.  Jim is on the Fung Loy Kok Institute of Taoism Board of Directors and is a student of the temple arts that Mr. Moy has shared with us.  You'll find that the many jobs and committees for the workshop are listed on posters attached to the mirrors at the center.  The Branch Council hopes that many of you will not only be able to attend the workshop, but will be compelled to help out at the various tasks.  The cooking crew is in place already and various tasks involved with carrying out the meals during the workshop will be assigned to all of those attending and not just Brandon/Temple Terrace/Sun City/Wesley Chapel/Palma Ceia members.  We will need volunteers to help with airport pick-ups and drop-offs &mdash; the more people involved, the less each has to do.  We are also looking for hosts for people requesting billeting during the workshop.  Sign- up sheets are on the card table in front of the mirrors in Brandon and should be available in Temple Terrace as well.  Just list your preferences on the forms.  Billeting is an excellent way to meet members from other centers around the country and possibly, from around the world.  Often, this leads to your guest(s)  hosting you when you are in their area.  Keep an open mind!</p>

<p>If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask your instructors &mdash; they should be able to give you some guidance in these matters.</p>
