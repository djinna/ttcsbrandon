<p>Hello My Friends:</p>

<p>Here is your link to the Tampa Bay area newsletter:  <a href="http://dunedin.florida.usa.taoist.org/pdf/201301issue1.pdf">http://dunedin.florida.usa.taoist.org/pdf/201301issue1.pdf</a></p>

<p>The New Year is upon us and there's lot's of things tai chi to do and participate in.</p>

<p>Saturday, January 12 will be the <a href="[% site.uris.pdfs %]/2013-01-13-openouse.pdf">Open Houses</a> before the new term of beginner classes start.  Brandon will host from 11am to 1pm and Temple Terrace will host from 2 to 4pm.  The Tampa Tribune printed the date as January 5--we've made every effort to correct this, so help get the word out with the correct date.</p>

<p>The following weekend (Jan. 19 &amp; 20) will be the <a href="http://dunedin.florida.usa.taoist.org/pdf/20130120wsFlyer.pdf">International Tai Chi Workshop hosted by the Dunedin branch</a>.  Word has come down (that makes me the bottom) that Andrew Hung is tentatively scheduled to lead.  Andrew is an international director for the Society and the director of the Orangeville campus.  Put this one on your Bucket List!</p>

<p>Monday, January 21, Dunedin will also be hosting an intensive and lunch geared toward beginners finishing their first term (graduation) and for non-beginners as well. The intensive is from 10am to 1pm, followed by lunch, for $30. Andrew will be hosting this as Tony Kwong did last year in St. Pete.  There was quite a large turnout for that one.  Of note:  There will be no daytime classes that day per Sean Dennison.  We have been instructed that when there is an international instructor in the area, all instructors and set leaders should attempt to attend and receive instruction of a high caliber.  Having to teach or set lead for a class is not an excuse to be absent and cancelling classes takes that excuse away.  I hope to see all of you there.</p>

<p>February proves to be full of tai chi and social events.</p>

<p>Saturday, February 9, from 2 to 5pm, Sarasota will host a tai chi intensive followed by a Greek dinner.</p>

<p>Tuesday, February 12, Dunedin will be hosting their annual High Tea from 11:30am to 2pm.</p>

<p>Sunday, February 17, St. pete will be hosting the Chinese New Year banquet from 1 to 4pm.</p>

<p>It's not too early to begin planning for the International Instructor Workshop in Tallahasse from March 13 to 17.  They will be producing their Chinese New Year banquet on Saturday, March 16.  Five days or just the weekend, you can't go wrong.</p>

<p>Here's an <a href="http://ittcs.wordpress.com/2010/12/18/note-on-anatomy-and-physiology-keeping-supple-the-focus-of-our-practice/">article from the Tiger's Mouth blog on the International website</a>.  I think you might enjoy it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note on Anatomy and Physiology: Suppleness of Focus</p>

<p>We've concentrated a lot lately on the upper limbs. We've emphasized that, because the hands form one end of a number of continuities running through the body, their proper use has a significant impact on all our movements.</p>
<p>But the hands, although intimately connected to the centre, are situated out in the periphery. While they do serve as a terminus for powerful elastics and provide direction for these lines of force, the power resides along the full length of the elastic. The hands are but the tip of the whip.</p>
<p>Inevitably in our practice, we sometimes put too little intention into our movements. In the tor yu, for example, the hands may not get sent out far enough or the back leg fails to fully straighten. Connection is then lost between regions of the body.</p>
<p>On other occasions, we place too much focus on the hands and neglect to relax the elbows. This tugs too strongly on the structures that link hands to torso &emdash; the pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi and thoracolumbar fascia. Now there is insufficient play in the tissues; it becomes difficult to relax and settle the weight. The amount of stretch available to the body's tissues is finite; use too much in one locale and there is not enough in another.</p>
<p>With the search for the right amount of intention, there gradually awakens a sense of the middle. The handle of the whip. This is a region that proves much more mysterious than the hands. Finding the middle is to discover the dragon sitting on its treasure. As we engage the spine, pelvis and legs, the movements of the hands and feet become light and unpremeditated.</p>
<p>Clearly, a suppleness of focus is requisite to our practice. Today's insights represent an essential stage along the way but will eventually be replaced by deeper understandings. The art is learned sequentially. Once something is comprehended, it becomes programmed into our movements and forgotten at the conscious level. What struck us as crucial, the arms for instance, now seems,paradoxically, unimportant.</p>
<p>Further, the endeavour requires patience. A willingness to give our awareness of the body time to develop. And the mind time to settle. For most of us, this unfolds over many years. Patterns of posture, movement and thinking gradually shift. Areas of weakness or tightness, and troubles with connections between spine, pelvis and lower limbs, slowly alter. Difficulties of the mind and spirit sort themselves out.</p>
<p>The myriad of ways humans are potentially able to learn to move allows great freedom in acquiring new skills. But it also induces confusion and consternation in the adult mind as we go through the process. Altering the rhythm of practice is helpful. Changing focus to keep things fresh. The set informs the tor yu and don yu, as well as the reverse. When starting the day's practice, begin with what you find difficult; the body is often most ready to discover new things when it firsts begins to move. Each day's practice is a fresh introduction to the art.</p>
<p>We move forward by making discoveries from our own practice, by learning from the instructors who watch over and guide us, and by teaching. Too little of one weakens the impact of the others. Each of us needs to look for the right balance &emdash; a balance that shifts as we go along.</p>
