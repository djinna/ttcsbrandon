<p>Greetings and Felicitations my friends.  Another month has gone by and it's time for the rantings and ravings of the Bald Tai Chi Player (BTCP to you).  Here is your link to the Tampa Bay area newsletter: <a href="http://dunedin.florida.usa.taoist.org/pdf/201303issue03.pdf">http://dunedin.florida.usa.taoist.org/pdf/201303issue03.pdf</a>.</p>

<p>Here's a picture from our center in Denver:</p>

<p>Simple directions or a deeper meaning?  Hmmm.</p>

<p>I'd like to remind you of a few upcoming events.  This Saturday, march 9, will be the next Instructor Class.  That will run from 10am to 1pm and lunch is $5 if you so choose to indulge.  Daylight Savings Time is supposed to begin the next day (Mar 10) &mdash; time to spring forward.</p>

<p>Tallahassee is hosting the International Instructor's Workshop March 13-17.  On Saturday, March 16, they will be preparing and serving a Chinese New Year banquet.</p>

<p>On Saturday, March 23, the St. Pete branch will be hosting a tai chi intensive from 9am to noon followed by lunch and their Branch Annual Meeting (BAM).</p>

<p>Sunday, March 24, the Sarasota branch will host Spring Sip &amp; Savor.  Fine wines, gourmet chocolates and cheeses, and witty repartee are promised.  Not just for Epicurians!</p>

<p>Friday, March 29, will be the next breakfast at the Brandon center at 8am.  Come and eat, be merry, then stay for continuing class at 9am.  Such a deal!</p>

<p>April allows more opportunities for instruction and interaction with the rest of the Bay area.  On Saturday, April 6, Sarasota will be hosting the Beginner Instructor Module from 12-5pm.  Suggested donation is $25.  Even if you've attended before, it's always nice for those who've done so to help guide the first timers (remember what is was like to be a beginner?).</p>

<p>Here in Brandon, we will be having the second Road Clean-up of the year before skipping the heat of the summer months.  I want to thank those who regularly participate and those who just drop in once-in-a-while.  This is a service to our community and very much part of the Society's aims &amp; objectives.</p>

<p>Friday, April 26 will be the monthly breakfast in Brandon (check hyperbole for previous month).</p>

<p>Saturday, April 27, Sarasota (again!) will be hosting a tai chi intensive from 10am to 1pm followed by their BAM.</p>

<p>It's not too early to add to your calendars the Tai Chi Workshop in Brandon during Memorial Day weekend (May 25-26).  Once the IIW in Tallahassee is over, we can start sending out flyers for this event and planning the particulars.  This will be here sooner than you think.</p>

<p>Here's a little "something" to help you digest all of those breakfasts you'll be eating with us:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By three methods we may learn wisdom: First, by reflection, which is noblest; Second, by imitation, which is easiest; and third by experience, which is the bitterest.<br/>
&mdash; Confucius</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is BTCP signing off from somewhere out in cyberspace,</p>

<p>Shalom.
