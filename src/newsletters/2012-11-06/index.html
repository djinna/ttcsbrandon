<p>Hello Tai Chi Playmates:</p>
 
<p>Here is your link to the Tampa Bay area newsletter:  <a href="http://dunedin.florida.usa.taoist.org/pdf/201211issue40.pdf">http://dunedin.florida.usa.taoist.org/pdf/201211issue40.pdf</a></p>
 
<p>We had a successful Daytime Intensive on Friday, November 2.  We had 32 just from Temple Terrace and Brandon.  Thanks for your support!  This is the first time we cooked the lunch instead of going to a restaurant.  No one died or got sick so I'd say it went nicely, but I'm an optimist.  If you missed it, we had glazed turkey, cranberry sauce, spinach salad with mandarin arranges and sliced walnuts in a raspberry vinaigrette, roasted vegetables, a wild rice combination. And pumpkin pie with whipped cream.  Nah nah, should have been here.  :&gt;)</p>
 
<p>This week is the International Tai Chi Workshop and CIT Weekend in Tallahassee.  Classes will run as usual, but you may have a different instructor A(or two) to deal with.  React accordingly.</p>
 
<p>If you are going to be around while some of us are away, there is a demo at the Nativity Church Novemberfest on Thursday, Nov. 8 at 4:15pm.  Your help would be greatly appreciated.  Many people attend this event, so it's more impressive if we have lots of bodies participating.  You never know whose life you may affect.</p>
 
<p>The following Thursday, Nov. 15, will be a demo at Yates Elementary School at 10am.  We've attended there before and it's been a riot with the kids.  We've gotten cards and letters from the children telling us how much they enjoyed it and how it helped reduce the stress in their life and how they had a lot of back pain and it now felt better.  Elementary School!  You can't make this stuff up.  Sign- up sheets for both demos are at the center.</p>
 
<p>If you are interested, there's a 2-day workshop in Aruba Nov. 24 and 25.  $100 USD.</p>
 
<p>Saturday, December 1, will be the fourth and final Adopt-a-Road cleanup for 2012.  Some of the usual suspects (you know who you are) will be down in Miami attending the Kuan Yin Shrine Enlivening and First Half of Luk Hup Workshop.  That's Dec. 1 and 2.  Then, some are going on a Bahama cruise from Dec. 3 to 7.  Marsha Eberhardt, the president of Fung Loy Kok, and Sean Dennison will be leading that workshop.  Marsha and Sean will then be visiting the Tampa Bay area Dec. 3 and 4.  On Monday, Dec. 3, they will be in Brandon and will take the last half hour of the morning continuing class (10:30 to 11) to have a shrine enlivening of our own.  Everyone I welcome to attend.  Afterward, Sean wants to have a little lunch with us (cooked in our own kitchen).  That evening, they will go to Sarasota and will lead an intensive from 6 to 9pm ($25).  Tuesday morning they will be in St. Pete and Tuesday evening they will be in Dunedin leading an intensive from 6 to 9pm ($25).  If you are able, please take advantage of their wealth of experience and insights.</p>
 
<p>Sunday, Dec. 9, will be the Brandon Holiday Party at 4pm.  With the construction completed, we will be able to enjoy the party in our own center.  Come one, come all!</p>
 
<p>Thank you for your attention.</p>
 
<p>Since I called you Playmates, I guess that makes me...</p>
