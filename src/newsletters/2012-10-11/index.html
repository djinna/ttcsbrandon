<p>On another note, we received an email from long-time member Dan Richards, that his wife Marcia, passed away last Friday.  Our thought, prayers, and chants go out to Dan and his family.  Here is a copy of the letter with Dan's condolence wishes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>From:</strong> danwork10@verizon.net<br/>
<strong>Date:</strong> Wed, 10 Oct 2012 09:15:12 -0500 (CDT)<br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> Marcia Richards</p>

<p>I am attaching info about Marcia's Memorial Mass that you may share with all.  If anyone wants to contact me, please use this email address.  I am not ready to talk and the phone is always busy.  I don't think I will be ready for visitors until after the mass.  Marcia is being cremated and will be interred at Bushnell.</p>

<p>A memorial mass is scheduled on Wednesday 31 October at 2pm.  The mass will be at Saint Steven Catholic Church in Brandon.</p>

<p>Pastor:  Fr. Bill Swengros<br/>
Coordinator:  Susie DeCort<br/>
Approximate Length: 1 Â¼ hours</p>

<p>We will have table in front of the alter for flowers, picture of Marcia, Bellevue cap, etc., and a program for those present to follow along that is likely to be prepared for us by Church but may have a section where we can personalize/add thanks/etc. There will be guest book to sign.</p>

<p>We plan a celebration of Marcia's life at a reception at a yet to be determined hotel 4-6pm.  As we get info, I will pass it on.</p>

<p>Marcia's obit, written by her son, is in Sundays Tampa Tribune and at this site.</p>
