  <p id="p-5"><span class="leader">What Happens at an Open House?</span> &middot; During an Open House, we'll demonstrate the 108 movements of the Taoist Tai Chi® taijiquan set and explain how they would be introduced, step-by-step, in a set of beginner classes over the course of four months. We'll discuss the health benefits of regular practice of Taoist Tai Chi® internal arts. When the Open House is over, you should have a good idea of how our classes our taught, what it is like to be a member, and you'll be ready to join our next class.</p>

  <p id="p-5"><span class="leader">What is Taught in a Beginner Class?</span> &middot; Our beginner class offers a friendly environment to introduce students to Taoist Tai Chi® taijiquan. In the beginner class you will progressively learn the sequence of moves of Taoist Tai Chi® taijiquan, the art of longevity and health. One of our nationally-accredited instructors will demonstrate each move and give you guidance on how to perform them. Within 4 months of weekly classes you will learn all 108 moves of the set. Beginner classes are offered in <a href="[% site.uris.schedule %]#brandon-beginner">Brandon</a>, <a href="[% site.uris.schedule %]#templeterrace-beginner">Temple Terrace</a>, <a href="[% site.uris.schedule %]#palmaceia-beginner">Palma Ceia</a>, <a href="[% site.uris.schedule %]#sebastian-beginner">Sebastian</a> and <a href="[% site.uris.schedule %]#suncity-beginner">Sun City Center</a>.</p>

  <p id="p-6">The normal beginner class sessions follow the Open House. At our Brandon Branch, a beginner is welcome to attend any, or all, of our classes. All of our beginner classes keep roughly the same pace of instruction, so that you can attend any of the classes and not miss anything. The goal of the beginner class is to introduce the 108 movements of the Taoist Tai Chi® taijiquan set and begin to improve our health.</p>

  <p id="p-7">Visitors are always welcome at all of our classes. However, we encourage those that are interested to attend an Open House, because during the Open House, we have plenty of time to answer your questions. You will also have the opportunity to see a demonstration and benefit from hearing the questions of others.</p>

  <p id="p-8"><span class="leader">How Should I Dress?</span> &middot; You will be moving around, so we recommend that you wear comfortable, loose clothing and flat-bottomed shoes. No particular clothing needs to be purchased. For the first class, please arrive 15 minutes early for registration and orientation.
